# 🧠 LangChain SQL Agent with Ollama and Titanic Dataset

This project demonstrates how to use **LangChain** and a **local LLM via Ollama** to create an intelligent SQL agent that can answer **natural language questions** by querying a **SQLite database** generated from the **Titanic dataset**.

It is a great starting point to learn how to combine **large language models (LLMs)**, **LangChain**, and **SQL** to build powerful AI-driven analytics and data exploration tools.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Convert natural language to SQL using LangChain and LLM
- ✅ Use a local LLM model (`llama3:latest`) via Ollama for inference
- ✅ Create a SQLite database from the Titanic CSV dataset
- ✅ Answer questions like:
  - “What’s the average age of survivors?”
  - “How many passengers were under age 10?”
  - “List all column names”
  - “Show top 10 rows”
